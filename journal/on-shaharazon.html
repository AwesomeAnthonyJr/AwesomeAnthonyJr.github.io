                <h1>On SHAHARAZON</h1>
                <h2>By <a href="/about#AnthonyDSalsbury">Anthony D. Salsbury</a></h2>
                <p> SHAHARAZON is a project that holds a really special place in my heart. It's not my best work, or my most interesting idea, but it would lay the foundation
                    for what games my studio could create. For starters, it was the first game jam I would every enter. SHAHARAZON was originally created for Acerola Jam 0
                    following the theme of "aberration". As per the rules of the jam this game was created solely by myself. I was still in high school when I entered the
                    game jam, so I made SHAHARAZON in the free time I had while managing a full courseload. Looking back on it, it's honestly a miracle that SHAHARAZON turned
                    out as good as it did, even if it's not up to the standards that I have anymore. At the same time, SHAHARAZON was loved by those who played it and it
                    created a little community of its own.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> The development of SHAHARAZON began with the base idea of a first person shooter without guns, only grenades. Everything else about the game would be
                    determined during the active development, which led to an extremely messy project structure. For a little background, I began learning game development
                    with the Unity game engine, but when they announced their "charging developers cents per download" pricing plan, I jumped ship to Godot - which I had heard
                    great things about. SHAHARAZON was only my 3rd ever finished Godot project, and was signigicantly larger in scope than the small games I had finished in the
                    engine to learn the basics. SHAHARAZON was integral to growing my game development skills, and I did a lot of things that I would today look back on and
                    say I did incorrectly. Any attempts I have made to add to the game or update it have failed as a result of my poor practices at the time.
