                <h1>On SHAHARAZON</h1>
                <h2>By <a href="/about#AnthonyDSalsbury">Anthony D. Salsbury</a></h2>
                <p> SHAHARAZON is a project that holds a really special place in my heart. It's not my best work, or my most interesting idea, but it would lay the foundation
                    for what games my studio could create. For starters, it was the first game jam I would every enter. SHAHARAZON was originally created for Acerola Jam 0
                    following the theme of "aberration". As per the rules of the jam this game was created solely by myself. I was still in high school when I entered the
                    game jam, so I made SHAHARAZON in the free time I had while managing a full courseload. Looking back on it, it's honestly a miracle that SHAHARAZON turned
                    out as good as it did, even if it's not up to the standards that I have anymore. At the same time, SHAHARAZON was loved by those who played it and it
                    created a little community of its own.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p> The development of SHAHARAZON began with the base idea of a first person shooter without guns, only grenades. Everything else about the game would be
                    determined during the active development, which led to an extremely messy project structure. For a little background, I began learning game development
                    with the Unity game engine, but when they announced their "charging developers cents per download" pricing plan, I jumped ship to Godot - which I had heard
                    great things about. SHAHARAZON was only my 3rd ever finished Godot project, and was signigicantly larger in scope than the small games I had finished in the
                    engine to learn the basics. SHAHARAZON was integral to growing my game development skills, and I did a lot of things that I would today look back on and
                    say I did incorrectly. For example, here's some tips that I learned through making the mistakes during the creation of SHAHARAZON:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Do not hardcode your animations! Use Godot's built-in animation player if you can, it's very useful. If you have any animation with a variable amount
                    of time between the frames, it can make sense to hardcode it, but in that case, don't create and delete a timer each time, just use a timer node if you find
                    yourself creating and deleting timers over and over again.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Using <span>free()</span> is a bad idea unless you seriously know what you are doing. If you're running into issues with <span>queue_free()</span> and they 
                    go away with <span>free()</span> like I had, they don't actually stop happening, just the error messages go away. A useful tip I've found to account
                    for memory leaks in my projects every since I learned about SHAHARAZON's memory leak is to use the <span>print_orphan_nodes()</span> function in your
                    main script in the process call, so then if ever there is an orphaned node (Godot's version of the memory leak) then you'll immediately know while testing,
                    rather than finding out months later when you learn why it's running so slow.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> When you add audio settings (and you should), DO NOT hardcode your volume changing, there's a very simple built in feature called the audio bus which if I had used would've
                    vastly improved the sound quality of the game.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Unless any feature of your game is very complicated, its script should be under 1000 lines long, as a general rule of thumb, it's best to split those up.
                    For example, I had my UI elements all tied to my player script. It made sense at the time, but ultimately bloated the player script and forced a lot of coupling
                    between two distinct aspects of the game. In hindsight for this example, I should've had the player script reference a UI script which manages everything in the
                    UI, and sending it the information when something updates. Heavy coupling can kill any long-term development in your project (I would know).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Working in an object-oriented language means you should use that to your advantage, which is something I did not do during the development of SHAHARAZON.
                    So much time could've been saved while programming the very uncomplicated enemy AI if I didn't need to keep copy and pasting all the changes into different
                    scripts and I instead had used inheritance and polymorphism to my advantage. Simple things like this that you can establish early on in the project really
                    pay dividends during later development.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> On a more positive note, there's a lot of things that I did with the project that I would consider helpful. For example, I made heavy use of the LEGOs that I had
                    in my home to quickly prototype stages. As for a fun fact, the enemies in SHAHARAZON are actually pictures of LEGO robot-things that I built and posed to act as the enemies
                    because I knew I wouldn't be able to make the models I wanted in Blender fast enough for the game jam's timeframe (2 weeks). So I took pictures, shrunk them way down,
                    and limited the color palette of them, giving them a pixel-art "vibe" while being distinctly not "true" pixel-art. This did work in the game's favor, especially with
                    the theme of aberration being core to the game itself. Much of SHAHARAZON's style is actually a result of having limited art tools and time to make the game. Most
                    textures were of pictures I took, and lots of sprites were modified real images. The entire game is rendered at half of it's actual resolution and is then scaled-up
                    in order to make it look more "retro", making for the DOOM-like style of the game I was going for, while also obscuring the faults in the visuals. Having this
                    somewhat consistent style helped SHAHARAZON stand out amongst the other jam submissions. Having a distinct style in any case will always help your game have an identity
                    of its own.
                </p>
                <h3>Reception</h3>
                <p> Despite its flaws under the hood, SHAHARAZON was very well recieved for what it was. it placed #81 overall out of 930 entries, and was enjoyed by most who
                    had played it. Due to many intentional decisions on my part, the game was designed to be speedrunner friendly from the beginning, to the point that it spawned
                    a small speedrunning community, which you can check out on its <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/SHAHARAZON">speedrun.com</a> page. In fact, the world record
                    for level the first (the most popular level to run) is, at the time of writing this, held by some french guy who somehow found the game, and that's awesome.
                    With the success came countless positive comments, each a member of the game jam so many had their own ideas on how to improve it, and I'm extremely grateful
                    for those who game SHAHARAZON a chance and truly enjoyed it (if you would like to see these comments, you can find them game's rating page <a href="https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0/rate/2569641">here</a>).
                    Many called for me to upgrade the game and get it to a full release, and while I did try to develop the game for a week after the game jam's conclusion,
                    the complete mismanagement of the project during its development meant that it was pretty much impossible to cleanly add anything. On top of that, there
                    were so many conflicting ways to take the project, and ultimately I couldn't really figure out what to do with it, and so, SHAHARAZON ultimately stopped
                    being developed. Sometimes people who have played the game still ask me when I'll make a sequel or continue the project. Some to this day still say that
                    SHAHARAZON is the best work of the studio, and while I wouldn't count out a continuation of the core ideas, I've since moved on to other ideas. There's still
                    so much more I want to create, and while I still do love what I did with SHAHARAZON, it stands as a solid foundation for LeafLight Studios to grow from - flaws
                    and all.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Those are my thoughts looking back <strong>on SHAHARAZON.</strong></p>
