                            <h2>SHAHARAZON</h2>
                            <p>SHAHARAZON is a fast-paced movement shooter, and the first official LeafLight Studios game. It's a great place to start with out catalogue and is pretty fun if you enjoy fast-paced explosive gameplay. However, due to oversight and inexperience, SHAHARAZON contains a memory leak, so if your game starts to slow way down, that's why. Even still, SHAHARAZON is an important part of our roots and an enjoyable game. Reccomended for someone who enjoys the thrill of speeding through a level and doesn't mind dealing with the memory leak problem.</p>

                            <h2>Wyrm Canyon</h2>
                            <p>Wyrm Canyon is a small, arcade style game that you can play in a browser. It was made in a short time and is fun for a couple of runs, with the goal of getting the highest score you can. It definitely takes some getting used to, but it's fun once you've got the hang of how to hunt the Wyrms. Reccomended for anyone who wants to play a quick high-score based game to kill some time, or if you think giant sand worms would be really cool to fight.</p>

                            <h2>goblin knight</h2>
                            <p>goblin knight comes from an interesting idea, but as a standalone game isn't great. The idea, that being, skill-based melee combat where the player needs to aim their weapons is an interesting one and one that we want to come back to. However, goblin knight was made in a short time and didn't exactly reach the true potential of the idea. It's an okay protype, but not very fun to play. Reccomended for anyone who is deeply interested in the premise of the game, but know that it won't be very fun for most players.</p>

                            <h2>Mage Hand</h2>
                            <p>Mage Hand is a knowledge-based adventure game with several secrets to discover. The central mechanic is the "mage hand" itself, the player's hand which can cast any of the 40 spells in the game by various hand-sign combinations. It's very fun if you enjoy exploring secrets and delving deep into a game's mechanics. It takes some getting used to, but Mage Hand is a great game once you've memorized some spells. Reccomended for anyone who's willing to put the effort into learning a game's systems and wants to feel like a wizard as a result.</p>

                            <h2>Kill Protocol</h2>
                            <p>Kill Protocol is a fast-paced movement shooter featuring 17 different guns. It marries the ideas of Mage Hand and SHAHARAZON with movement-shooter gameplay and an aspect of knowledge-based progression as in Kill Protocol, using a gun's ID code you can transform any gun into any other (as long as they are of the same type). Reccomended for anyone who likes playing levels over and over again to improve at them, or anyone who just likes a clean mission-based shooter.</p>

                            <h2>XCVB</h2>
                            <p>XCVB is a very unique game, a combination of 2D platformer, deckbuilder roguelike, and twin stick shooter. You build a deck of movement cards and ascend a platforming gauntlet, all the while fighting off endless waves of continually strengthening enemies. There's 12 different starter packs to choose from as well, providing different replays for those who enjoy the game. Reccomended for the roguelike enjoyers, platformer fans, or really anyone who's looking to see what we can do as a studio.</p>
